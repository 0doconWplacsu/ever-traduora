Traduora is a **translation management platform for teams**. Once you setup your project you can import and export your translations to various formats, work together with your team, instantly deliver translation updates over the air, and *soon* automatically translate your project via third-party integrations.

We want traduora to become the home for managing your translation workflow, that's why we have made all of the core product **open-source** with the intention to grow a **community** and enable developers to build on top of it as a platform.


## Try it out

Traduora can be run just about anywhere. For a 5 second quickstart simply run our example docker-compose setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/traduora/traduora
cd traduora
docker-compose up
```

Now go to your browser on http://localhost:8080 and that's it!


## Deployment and configuration

Please check out the [configuration](configuration.md) and [deployment](deployment.md) documents for more information on deploying traduora.
