### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following
For us it's important to have the agreement of our contributors to use their work, whether it be code or documentation. Therefore, we are asking all contributors to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA) as commonly accepted in most open source projects.

The CLA is a license agreement, which enables "Traduora" to distribute your code without restriction. It doesn't require you to assign to us any copyright you have, the ownership of which remains in full with you.

Anyone wishing to contribute to the github.com/traduora/traduora project must read & sign our Contributor License Agreement.

Or you can also open the PR and our CLA bot will prompt you briefly.
