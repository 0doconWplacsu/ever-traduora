EverÂ® Traduora is a **translation management platform for teams**. Once you setup your project you can import and export your translations to various formats, work together with your team, instantly deliver translation updates over the air, and *soon* automatically translate your project via third-party integrations.

We want traduora to become the home for managing your translation workflow, that's why we have made all of the core product **open-source** with the intention to grow a **community** and enable developers to build on top of it as a platform. We are going to also use Traduora from our other open-source platforms (currently https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy and https://github.com/ever-co/ever-demand). You are welcome to check more information about the platforms at our official website - https://ever.co.
